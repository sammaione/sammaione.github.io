My partner, Emily, and I created _letters_, a grassroots community that organizes a biannual self-titled zine featuring a collection of political essays, commentary, and creative works written by the public, for the public. Born out of the frustration in the ripples of the 2025 ICE raids, our goal is to empower everyday people into taking political stances. We also run an information network to keep one another informed.
