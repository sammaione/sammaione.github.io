My partner, Emily, and I created _letters_, a grassroots community that organizes a biannual self-titled zine featuring a collection of political essays, commentary, and creative works written by the public, for the public. Born out of the frustration in the ripples of the 2025 ICE raids, our goal is to empower everyday people into taking political stances. We also run an information network to keep one another informed.

I am so thankful to my friends and strangers alike who took interest with this project.

Please see our Wordpress, here: . You may also be able to pick up a copy of our Zine at your local anarchist bookstore or coffee co-operation.
