Thank you for visiting my website. I graduated from SUNY Binghamton in 2023 with a BSc in Integrative Neuroscience. I joined [Dr. Shari Liu's lab](https://www.liulaboratory.org/) at Johns Hopkins Univeristy, where I became enamored with socially oriented cognitive psychology. I am interested in the way we think about groups--in particular, institutions and coalitions--and when and why we prioritize one over the other. For example, why do some people tend to believe a coalition member over an entire army of institutional agents? In understanding powerful groups like institutions and coalitions, I hope to better understand why so much of the United States is so distrustful of instititutions at large.
