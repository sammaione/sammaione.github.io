**Professional summary.** I graduated from SUNY Binghamton in 2023 with a BSc in Integrative Neuroscience, where I earned the [Steven W. Kovacs Memorial Award](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/undergraduate/undergraduate-awards.html#Kovacs) and [Undergraduate Research Award](https://www.binghamton.edu/student-research-and-scholarship/undergraduate-research/funding-and-awards/undergrad-research-award.html) for my passion towards psychological research as a volunteer research assistant in [Dr. Peter Gerhardstein's lab](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/labs/baby/). After graduating, I joined [Dr. Shari Liu's lab](https://www.liulaboratory.org/) at Johns Hopkins Univeristy as a full-time laboratory technician / lab manager. Here, we study the way people navigate the social and physical world through neuroimaging, behavioral tests, and developmental studies. While working in the Liulab, I worked with my undergraduate lab to turn my honors thesis into a publication that was recently accepted in [Frontiers of Neurology](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/689cm_v1). My first authored paper with Dr. Liu that tests whether human intuitive physical reasoning and goal directed attention rely on shared or distinct neural resources will be submitted for publication in the next few weeks.

**Research summary.** Public confidence in institutions reached [a 52 year low](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx) in the United States (aside for confidence in the military and science, though confidence in these institutions fell too from 2021-2025). Why? While a variety of political, economical, and historical reasons undoubtedly play a role in dwindling public perception of institutions, confidence in institutions still sinks lower year after year. If we can understand the way humans think about institutions, then maybe we can develop avenues to restore confidence in institutions. 

I am interested in the way people think about institutions and the ways institutions map on to coalitions. For example, when people navigate society, they are often members of both institutions and coalitions. Often times, your institution can tell you one thing, but your coalition may say another. What determines when someone chooses the information of their institution over their coalition, or vice-versa? As a second example, I am interested in how individuals and coalitions can and cannot be representative of institutions as a whole. If a person—or group of people—from an institution all say one thing, does it become representative of the overarching message of the institution? My current NSF GRFP proposal tackles these questions and will be posted here when ready.
